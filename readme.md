We know yards per carry and yards after contact are good stats for a running back.

Given the impact of turnovers on a games outcome, I believe that fumbles per carry and fumbles per yard may also be an interesting stat when deciding between two running backs who appear similar in quality.

For my first attempt, we will determing fumbles per game to allow for a single dataset.

Next we will rushing stats so that we can gain a more meaningful metric of yards per carry.

Next, for a more advanced metric that would add the weight of both yards per carry and fumbles per carry, we will calculate fumbles per yard.

Finally, we will add in receiving statistics to help account to allow for a more complete analysis.
